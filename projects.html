          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Situation:</strong> High variation and complaints; defects only seen once customers reacted.</li>
            <li><strong>What I did:</strong> Implemented SPC charts for critical parameters, set up alarms and trained
              operators/engineers on interpreting trends and capability.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced defects by 30%, variation by 20%, and complaints by 20–25% with more
              proactive control.</li>

          <h2 class="project-title">Lean QC Lab Transformation</h2>
          <p class="project-tagline">From bottleneck lab to reliable partner for production.</p>
          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Lab bottlenecks and frequent instrument breakdowns delayed release.</li>
            <li><strong>What I did:</strong> Redesigned lab workflows using Lean concepts, clarified priorities,
              and implemented preventive maintenance schedules.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Lab efficiency increased by 20%, instrument downtime cut by 50%, and
              release decisions became more predictable.</li>

          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Heavy reliance on supplier CoA with limited verification and feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>What I did:</strong> Defined verification plans, built supplier scorecards and led
              structured reviews with key suppliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Supplier defects reduced by 20% and delivery performance improved by 30%.</li>

            <li><strong>Situation:</strong> New products risked start-up issues and hidden quality problems.</li>
            <li><strong>What I did:</strong> Aligned QC methods, specifications and lab readiness with R&amp;D
              and production for each new product.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Supported launch of 10 new products with approximately 95% first-pass yield
              and reduced start-up complaints.</li>
